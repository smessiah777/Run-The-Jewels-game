<h3 align="center" >

Created a game that would auto generate a random number from 19 - 120.

Player is given four jewels/crystals that are assigned a random number value between 1 and 12.

Player must click each jewel/crystal in order to add them up and try to match the random 19 - 120 generated number.

If player can match the game number they will win the game, if not they will lose.

Game will reset, after a win or lose in a round.

Won and lost rounds are displayed for the player.
