# Run The Jewels Crystal Collector

### Created a game that would auto generate a random number from 19 - 120.

### Player is given four jewels/crystals that are assigned a random number value between 1 and 12.

### Player must click each jewel/crystal in order to add them up and try to match the random 19 - 120 generated number.

### If player can they will win the game, if not they will lose.

### Game will reset, after a win or lose of a round.

### Won and lost rounds will be displayed for the player.
