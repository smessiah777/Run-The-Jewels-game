# unit-4-game Crystal Collector

Created a game that would auto generate a random number from 19 - 120.

Player is given four jewels/crystals that are assigned a random number value between 1 and 12.

Player must click each jewel/crystal in order to add them up and try to match the random 19 - 120 generated number.

Game will reset, after a win or lose of a round.

Won and lost rounds will be displayed for the player.

I went with a "Run The Jewels" theme.
